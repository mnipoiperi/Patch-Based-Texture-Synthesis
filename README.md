# Patch-Based-Texture-Synthesis
It's an implementation of Efros and Freeman's "Image Quilting and Texture Synthesis" 2001

The output depends on two factors : PatchSize and OverlapWidth
The running time depends on Sample Image dimensions, Desired Image dimensions, ThresholdConstant and PatchSize

## To run the code, copy the following into your command line
'python PatchBasedSynthesis.py /image/source.jpg Patch_Size Overlap_Width Initial_Threshold_error'

for example
'python PatchBasedSynthesis.py corn.jpg 30 5 78.0'
